PSXperia Emulator Converter Tool
1.0 Release
By Yifan Lu (http://yifan.lu/)
========================================

This tool will take a PSX image that you legally own and convert it to be playable on the Xperia Play with the emulator extracted from the packaged game "Crash Bandicoot."

If you just want to use the tool, make sure you have Java installed and download the binaries from GitHub (https://github.com/yifanlu/PSXperia/downloads).
Open "PSXperiaTool.jar" or the helper script ("psxperiatool-gui" or "psxperiatool-gui-windows.bat") if you cannot open .jar files.
You can also use the helper scripts "psxperiatool" and "psxperiatool-windows.bat" from the command line for command line mode (see below).
After converting, in the output folder that you selected, you'll find an APK file and a "data" folder. Install the APK on your Xperia Play phone and merge the "data" folder with "Android/data" on the SD card of your phone.

For detailed directions, check out the [wiki](https://github.com/yifanlu/PSXperia/wiki).
