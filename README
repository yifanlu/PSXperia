PSXperia Emulator Converter Tool
Beta 2 Release
By Yifan Lu (http://yifan.lu/)
========================================

This tool will take a PSX image that you legally own and convert it to be playable on the Xperia Play with the emulator extracted from the packaged game "Crash Bandicoot."

To build, you need to copy the following to the "lib" directory
* apktool.jar from http://code.google.com/p/android-apktool/
* commons-io-2.0.1.jar from http://commons.apache.org/io/download_io.cgi
* sdklib.jar from Android SDK (under tools/lib)
* swing-layout-1.0.4.jar from Netbeans (under platform/modules/ext)

You also need a copy of "aapt" from Android SDK (under platform-tools)
* OSX version named aapt-osx
* Windows version named aapt-windows.exe
* Linux version named aapt-linux
Put these in the "resources" directory

Finally, you need my PSXperia wrapper library (compiled) in the "resources" directory

To run the GUI, use "java -jar PSXperiaTool.jar"
To run the command line tool, use "java -cp PSXperiaTool.jar com.yifanlu.PSXperiaTool.Interface.CommandLine" to see usage directions, which is also listed below for your convenience.
